            <h2>What this meme is about</h2>
            <p>
                This meme jokes about how many websites rely on Cloudflare for DNS, CDN, and security services.
                When Cloudflare experiences an outage, it can feel like half of the Internet suddenly stops working,
                similar to Thanos snapping away half the universe in <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>.
